# Eta NoFib: Test & Benchmark Suite

This is a set of benchmarks for functional languages, popularly known as `nofib`, that has been adapted for the Eta programming language.

## Methodology
The [Java Micobenchmarking Harness](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) is used to conduct the benchmarks. The follow process occurs when you run a benchmark:

1. The benchmark is compiled into a JAR file.
2. The `eta.main.main` method (the entry point into Eta programs) is invoked from the
   JMH framework.
3. The JMH framework will fork a single JVM process and run the program 5 times for
   warmup and 5 times for measurement and the average/error is calculated.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Maven
- JDK 1.7+
- Eta

### Runner Installation

First, install the runner:

`$ stack install`

## Running
 All runs of the runner should be at the root of the repository.

### To run an individual test
`$ nofib-runner [test-name] --run`

Example:
`$ nofib-runner scs --run`

### To run an entire suite
`$ nofib-runner [suite-name] --run`

Example:
`$ nofib-runner imaginary --run`

### Clean up test/benchmark artifacts
`$ nofib-runner clean`

## Benchmarking against GHC

#### Comments

- The Eta timing measurements occur after the JIT compiler has done its work.
  If you just do a single shot timing, you won't see these results because the
  overhead of classloading, interpretation, and the JIT will be there.

- The cases in which Eta is doing better than GHC attest to the fact that the code
  generated by Eta is suitable for proper Just-In-Time compilation. GHC's code once
  generated is more or less static so cannot do any form of optimization during
  runtime.

- The cases in which Eta is doing worse than GHC are due to the fact that the Eta
  bytecode still needs lots of optimization. Some trivial optimizations in Eta were
  intentionally not implemented yet so that the upper bound on the Eta runtime
  implementation is seen.

#### Replicating the results

`$ ./eta-benchmarks.sh`

If you see any major differences, please report your results as an [issue](https://github.com/rahulmutt/nofib/issues/new) or on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/typelead/eta).
